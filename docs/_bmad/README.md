# BMAD — Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development

This directory contains BMAD configuration for developing the 16s platform itself.

## Structure

- `docs/` — Project context and briefs
- `agents/` — Role-specific agent prompts (PM, Architect, UX Designer, Developer, QA)
- `workflows/` — Step-by-step processes for common development tasks
- `templates/` — Reusable document templates for PRDs, stories, and architecture decisions

## Usage

Reference these files when working on 16s platform features. Each agent file defines a role's scope, context, and responsibilities. Workflows guide you through specific development processes. Templates provide consistent structure for documentation.
