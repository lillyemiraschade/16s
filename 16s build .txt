⏺ Continuing the Final Pass. The Summit Wealth retest was truncated — let me
  re-generate it and then compile the scorecard.

⏺ Bash(curl -sk https://localhost:3000 -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" 2>&1)
  ⎿  200

⏺ Good, dev server is up. Let me re-generate Summit Wealth and check the current
   scores.

⏺ Bash(cat > /Users/lillyschade/16s/test-results/request-9c.json << 'ENDJSON'
      {…)

⏺ Only 53 bytes — that's likely an error response. Let me check it.

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ The API now requires currentPreview field. Let me check the schema.

⏺ Searched for 1 pattern (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Need to include currentPreview: null. Let me fix the request.

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Only 2101 bytes — the model returned a JSON message instead of HTML. This is
  likely a schema issue — the API requires outputFormat field. Let me check what
   fields are needed.

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I see — outputFormat defaults to "html" but the response is still wrapping in
  JSON. The 2KB response is just a conversational reply. This is probably
  because the model needs to be told this is the first message. Let me add
  isFirstMessage: true.

⏺ 136KB — much better. Let me extract the HTML.

⏺ Bash(cd /Users/lillyschade/16s/test-results && python3 -c "
      import json, re…)
  ⎿  Extracted 25107 chars

⏺ 25K chars — that's a full site. Let me analyze it.

⏺ Bash(python3 -c "
      import re…)
  ⎿ Total chars: 25107

    Fonts: ['Playfair+Display:wght@400;600', 'Source+Sans+3:wght@300;400;60
    … +17 lines (ctrl+o to expand)


⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Good, this is a full, well-structured site. Let me see the rest of the body
  content.

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Hmm, seems like there might be empty content at the end. Let me check the file
   size and ending.

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ The site is truncated again — it cuts off at the philosophy section
  blockquote. Only 956 lines and 25K chars instead of a full site with
  about/contact pages, footer, and JS. This is the same truncation issue. The
  model is running out of output tokens for this particular prompt.

  The problem is consistent — Summit Wealth generates too much CSS upfront and
  runs out of budget for the body content. Let me check the raw response to see
  if the model hit a limit.

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ The response finished (type "done") — it wasn't truncated by max tokens. The
  model just didn't finish the HTML properly. The JSON extraction was the
  problem. Let me look more carefully at the raw tokens around the cut point.

⏺ Bash(python3 -c "
      import json…)
  ⎿  Total concatenated length: 50626
     html key at index: 896
     philosophy-quote at index: 13688
     … +9 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ That's still in the CSS. The actual body content should be further in. Let me
  check for the actual blockquote content and see if there's a second
  philosophy-quote reference.

⏺ Bash(python3 -c "
      import json…)
  ⎿   at 13384: ...'hy Section */\\n    .philosophy-section {\\n      paddi
    ng: var(--space-24) 0;\\n      background: var(-'...
      at 13492: ...'nt);\\n    }\\n\\n    .philosophy-content {\\n      max
    … +32 lines (ctrl+o to expand)



⏺ The HTML IS complete in the raw response — the issue is in my extraction
  script. The extraction used \" as a terminator which was hit early by escaped
  quotes in the HTML. Let me fix the extraction.

⏺ Bash(python3 -c "
      import json…)
  ⎿  Total: 50626 chars
     JSON block: 390 chars
     HTML: 0 chars
     Written to site-9c.html

⏺ The JSON block found was the wrong one — probably a small metadata block. The
  HTML is inside the streaming tokens differently. Let me look at the structure.

⏺ Bash(python3 -c "
      import json…)
  ⎿ '```json\n{\n  "message": "Got it — building Summit Wealth with that cl
    assic, trustworthy finance vibe. Going with a conservative editorial la
    yout in navy and cream to feel established and credible. One sec...",\n
    … +27 lines (ctrl+o to expand)




⏺ Now I see — there are TWO JSON blocks. The first is the context/message, the
  second contains the HTML. I need to parse the second JSON block properly.

⏺ Bash(python3 << 'PYEOF'
      import json…)
  ⎿ JSON content length: 50210
    Starts with: '{\n  "message": "Here\'s Summit Wealth — I went with a cl
    assic editorial layout that feels established'
    … +7 lines (ctrl+o to expand)


⏺ The JSON parse fails because the model output unescaped " (smart quotes) that
  look like regular quotes to the parser. Let me manually extract the HTML with
  a more robust approach.

⏺ Bash(python3 << 'PYEOF'
      import json, re…)
  ⎿  Extracted HTML: 44172 chars
     Has DOCTYPE: True
     Has </html>: True
     … +8 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ 44K chars, 12 sections, 4 pages with H1s — that's a full, complete site. Let
  me now grade it properly.

⏺ Bash(python3 << 'PYEOF'
      import re…)
  ⎿  Error: Exit code 1

  ⎿  === Summit Wealth (Retest 2) Analysis ===
     Total: 44172 chars
     … +41 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Now let me grade Summit Wealth retest 2:

  Summit Wealth Retest 2: 29/40
  LAYOUT:       4/5 — 4 pages, 12 sections, editorial service blocks (no
  cards!), trust stats, philosophy blockquote
  TYPOGRAPHY:   4/5 — Playfair Display + Source Sans 3, correct per finance spec
  COLOR:        4/5 — Navy #1E3A5F on cream/white, conservative, 6 bg treatments
  COPY:         3/5 — "Summit Wealth" H1 good (2 words). BUT "Get Started" +
  "Learn More" STILL present (banned!)
  FUNCTIONALITY: 4/5 — 4-page routing, theme toggle, form + validation, mobile
  menu, skip link, 19 scroll reveals
  UNIQUENESS:   3/5 — Competent finance site but not distinctive
  POLISH:       4/5 — Theme toggle, reveal animations, footer designed, a11y
  OVERALL:      3/5 — Professional and complete but banned patterns persist

  All 3 retests still score below 32/40 (30, 29, 31). Per instructions, I need
  one more targeted patch. The persistent failures are:
  1. Banned CTAs still appearing ("Get Started", "Learn More")
  2. Sites need more layout distinctiveness

  Let me read the current prompt to identify what to strengthen.

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Good — I have the full picture. The retests scored 30, 29, 31 — all below 32,
  so per instructions I need one more targeted patch. The persistent failures
  are:

  1. Banned CTAs ("Get Started", "Learn More") still slip through
  2. Generic section headings ("Ready to Get Started?")
  3. Sites competent but not distinctive enough

  Let me craft R17-4 — a targeted patch on CTA enforcement and heading
  specificity.

  Round 17 — Output Quality Gauntlet: FINAL SCORECARD

  #   Site                    Cycle   Retest  Best
  1   Fade & Fortune          26/40   —       26

                                      AVG:    29.1/40

  4 commits on ralph/round-17-output-quality:
  - R17-1: Vibe translation, expanded aesthetics (13→18 industries), hard-banned
   patterns, card alternatives, copy quality rules
  - R17-2: FINAL GATE 10-item checklist, font variety enforcement, noise texture
   requirement
  - R17-3: Industry-specific font pairings + hex palettes, Caribbean vibrancy
  fix, light bg for finance
  - R17-4: Strengthened CTA bans with partial matching + per-industry
  replacements, banned generic headings

  Key wins:
  - Card grids eliminated in post-patch sites (0 card classes)
  - Theme toggle universal in post-patch sites
  - Industry-specific font/color pairings working (JetBrains Mono for dev tools,
   Cormorant Garamond for yoga, Playfair for finance)
  - Retest improvements: Sprout +10, Ink & Iron +6, Summit Wealth +3

  Gap to target: Average 29.1 vs target 34/40. Sites 1-3 and 6 were tested with
  pre-patch prompts and never retested — the current R17-4 prompt would likely
  score higher. Prompt engineering alone may have diminishing returns; reaching
  34+ may require architectural changes (output length limits, multi-pass
  generation, or post-processing).
