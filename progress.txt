## Log
- R12-1: Fixed streaming blank messages. Root cause: empty assistant placeholder was created immediately, hiding the typing indicator and showing a blank bubble. Fix: delay message creation via `upsertStreamingMsg` helper — message only appears when `extractStreamingMessage` returns non-empty text. Also hardened typing indicator to show when last assistant message has empty content.
- R12-2: Updated SECURITY.md to match current iframe sandbox config.
- R12-3: Lazy-loaded html2canvas (dynamic import at call site in usePreview.ts) and VoiceCall (next/dynamic in page.tsx). Monaco was already lazy, Stripe was already server-only. Result: 277→228 kB first load (-18%).
