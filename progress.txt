## Log
- R12-1: Fixed streaming blank messages. Root cause: empty assistant placeholder was created immediately, hiding the typing indicator and showing a blank bubble. Fix: delay message creation via `upsertStreamingMsg` helper — message only appears when `extractStreamingMessage` returns non-empty text. Also hardened typing indicator to show when last assistant message has empty content.
