# 16s Improvement Progress

## History
- Rounds 1-4: 113 code/prompt changes, prompt compressed 14K→5.9K tokens
- Round 5 (Flow): Conversation flow, inspo-first, photo intelligence
- Ultimate R1: 10 findings fixed (postMessage validation, Stripe rate limiting, auto-scroll yank, pill states, unhandled promises, decodeURI crash, error timer cleanup, modern CSS prompt, error toast UX, localStorage quota handling)

## Ultimate R1 found only 10 issues in 7 cycles.
That means the surface-level audit is exhausted. This round goes DEEPER.

## Round 2 Focus Areas
- Security: actually curl every endpoint, test auth bypass, test CORS, verify CSP works
- App UI: test at real device widths, test slow connections, test with 100+ messages
- Output quality: the AI prompt changes are untested — nobody has verified generated sites actually look different
- Integration testing: Supabase + Stripe + Vercel deploy chain end-to-end
- Stress testing: what breaks under load or extreme inputs?
- Mobile: the entire app on 375px width
