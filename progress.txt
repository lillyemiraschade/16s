# 16s Improvement Progress

## Rounds 1-4 Summary (113 changes)
All code-level improvements complete. System prompt compressed from 14K to 5.9K tokens.
Full ARIA coverage, clean console, dead code removed, all critical bugs fixed.

## Round 5 Focus: CONVERSATION FLOW & IMAGE INTELLIGENCE
The AI conversation is clunky. Users have to figure out how to give info, when to upload photos,
what kind of photos to give, and the AI doesn't guide them through it.

### Known Issues:
- Pill buttons sometimes don't render (message gets cut off mid-generation)
- AI asks for photos but doesn't specify WHAT KIND (inspo vs content)
- No structured flow for gathering user info (contact, socials, business details)
- AI doesn't know when to remove backgrounds vs use photos as-is
- Inspo images should be requested FIRST before any generation happens
- Photo placement is random — AI doesn't ask WHERE user wants photos
- User has to know the system to use it well — should be guided naturally

## Completed
- R5-1: PROMPT — Rewrite CONVERSATION FLOW to guided 6-step journey (inspo-first, smart photo placement, structured info gathering)
- R5-2: CODE — Add fallback pill generation when pills missing from AI response
- R5-3: PROMPT — Update voice call flow with conversation arc + inspo handoff
- R5-4: CODE — Improve bg removal + image type toggle discoverability
- R5-5: PROMPT — Add social link placement rules + showUpload hint for content photos
- R5-6: CODE — Increase max_tokens for complex generations (16K → 18K)

## In Progress
(next: PROMPT — showUpload hint for photo gathering step)
