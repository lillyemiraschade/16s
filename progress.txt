# Round 15: Audit & Billing Polish

## Part 1 — Critical Bugs
- [ ] 1. Fix domain: try16s.app in layout, middleware, Stripe routes, form handler
- [ ] 2. Fix CORS: allow /api/forms from any origin (deployed sites)
- [ ] 3. Deduplicate rate limiter: shared module → all 7 routes
- [ ] 4. Update .env.example with all R13+R14 env vars

## Part 2 — Billing System
- [ ] 5. Create /billing page (plan card, comparison, usage, success/cancel handling)
- [ ] 6. Upgrade prompts (insufficient credits → upgrade CTA, credits in UserMenu)
- [ ] 7. Credit deduction audit (missing subscription fallback, voice credits, error codes)
- [ ] 8. Webhook hardening (mid-cycle upgrade credits)

## Part 3 — Polish
- [ ] 9. Navigation links (UserMenu → billing/submissions/projects, header → templates)
- [ ] 10. Error states audit
- [ ] 11. Final verification pass

## Log
- [x] P0-0: Fixed streaming blank messages — immediate assistant message creation, auto-restore race condition guard, no-rethrow error handler
- [x] P0-1: GitHub Actions CI — already existed (.github/workflows/ci.yml with check + e2e jobs)
- [x] P0-2: check script — already existed in package.json
