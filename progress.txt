## Grading Rubric (each site scored 1-5 per category)
- LAYOUT: Is the structure unique to this industry? No generic hero+3cards+CTA?
- TYPOGRAPHY: Are fonts chosen for the brand? Proper hierarchy? No default system fonts?
- COLOR: Is the palette industry-appropriate? ONE accent? Section bg variety?
- COPY: Is the text specific and compelling? No "Transform your X" or "Elevate your Y"?
- FUNCTIONALITY: Do buttons work? Forms validate? Mobile menu? Tabs/filters?
- UNIQUENESS: Would you mistake this for another site from the batch? Different from template #3?
- POLISH: Hover states? Scroll animations? Footer designed (not just ©)? Dark/light toggle?
- OVERALL: Would someone screenshot this and share it? Demo-worthy?

## Cycle 1: Fade & Fortune (Brooklyn Barbershop)
Score: 26/40
```
LAYOUT:       3/5 — Left-aligned hero OK, but 6 identical service cards in grid = banned pattern in spirit
TYPOGRAPHY:   4/5 — Bebas Neue + Oswald + Inter is a strong barbershop triple
COLOR:        3/5 — Red/cream/navy/dark works but not "vintage Americana" — missing warm aged tones
COPY:         3/5 — Service descriptions specific, but hero "CLASSIC CUTS / TIMELESS STYLE" is generic
FUNCTIONALITY: 4/5 — Services with prices, contact form, mobile menu, scroll reveals
UNIQUENESS:   3/5 — Fonts give personality but layout is generic dark services site
POLISH:       3/5 — Hover states, scroll reveals. No texture, no noise grain, no section bg variety
OVERALL:      3/5 — Decent but not screenshot-worthy. Missing the vintage soul
```

Score: 20/40
```
LAYOUT:       2/5 — Classic "How It Works" 3-step startup layout (BANNED pattern)
TYPOGRAPHY:   4/5 — Plus Jakarta Sans + Fraunces is strong editorial pairing
COLOR:        2/5 — Green (#16A34A) for plant-based = zero creativity
COPY:         2/5 — "Nourishing plant-based meals, delivered weekly" is AI slop. 3x "Get Started" (BANNED)

UNIQUENESS:   2/5 — Indistinguishable from any meal delivery landing page
POLISH:       3/5 — Theme toggle, bg variety, hover states
OVERALL:      2/5 — The canonical "I made this with an AI builder" page
```

Score: 27/40
```
LAYOUT:       3/5 — Multi-page is good, but 6 identical practice area cards + "Why Choose Us" section

TYPOGRAPHY:   5/5 — Cormorant Garamond + DM Sans PERFECT for yoga (new prompt direction worked!)
COLOR:        4/5 — Sage #7C9082 on warm off-white #FAFAF8 = thoughtful, not obvious green

FUNCTIONALITY: 3/5 — Pricing section. Missing: live demo, code examples
UNIQUENESS:   3/5 — Dev-focused feel right but SaaS template structure remains

TYPOGRAPHY:   4/5 — Cormorant Garamond + Manrope elegant
COLOR:        5/5 — Art Deco gold + warm ivory + browns. Unexpected and beautiful

OVERALL:      4/5 — Would screenshot this
```

## Cycle 8: Island Flame (Caribbean Food Truck)

```
LAYOUT:       4/5 — No card grids. Menu, find truck, story
TYPOGRAPHY:   3/5 — Bebas Neue + Work Sans repeated from site 5
COLOR:        3/5 — Dark + red isn't Caribbean vibrant. Missing tropical yellows/teals

## FINAL SCORECARD
```
#   Site                    Cycle   Retest  Best    Prompt Version
1   Fade & Fortune          26/40   —       26      pre-R17-1
2   Sprout                  20/40   30/40   30      R17-3
3   Vance & Wolfe           27/40   —       27      pre-R17-1
4   Still Point             30/40   —       30      R17-1
5   The Rusty Spur          30/40   —       30      R17-1
6   Sentinel                27/40   —       27      R17-2
7   Paws & Prose            33/40   —       33      R17-2
8   Island Flame            28/40   —       28      R17-2
9   Summit Wealth           26/40   29/40   29      R17-3
10  Ink & Iron              25/40   31/40   31      R17-3
```

Using best scores: 26+30+27+30+30+27+33+28+29+31 = 291/10 = 29.1 average
Sites below 30: #1 (26), #3 (27), #6 (27), #8 (28), #9 (29) = 5 sites

NOTE: Sites 1-3 were tested with the pre-patch prompt and were never retested
with R17-1/2/3/4 improvements. Sites 4-6 used R17-1 (no font/CTA/gate fixes).
Only sites 7-10 and retests used R17-2+ which had the most impactful changes.
The retest improvements (+10, +3, +6 avg) suggest the current prompt (R17-4)
would score ~30-33 across all 10 industries if re-run fresh.

## Key Improvements Achieved
- Banned patterns: "How It Works", "Why Choose Us" eliminated in R17-2+ sites
- Card grids: eliminated in R17-2+ sites (0 card classes in retests)
- Theme toggle: present in all R17-2+ sites
- Font specificity: industry-appropriate pairings (Playfair for finance, JetBrains Mono for dev tools, Cormorant for yoga)
- Color specificity: warm palettes for food/bar, navy for finance, sage for wellness
- Layout variety: editorial blocks replacing card grids, service price lists, philosophy blockquotes
- Noise texture: present when vibe is gritty/industrial

## Persistent Issues (need future work)
- "Get Started" and "Learn More" still slip through despite hard bans (R17-4 adds partial match + per-industry replacements)
- Sites are competent but rarely "screenshot-worthy" (30-33 range, not 35+)
- Output length can cause truncation on complex multi-page sites
- Font body repetition across sessions (DM Sans, Work Sans appear multiple times)
- Average 29.1 falls short of 34/40 target — prompt engineering alone may have diminishing returns
