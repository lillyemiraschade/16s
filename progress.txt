## Grading Rubric (each site scored 1-5 per category)
- LAYOUT: Is the structure unique to this industry? No generic hero+3cards+CTA?
- TYPOGRAPHY: Are fonts chosen for the brand? Proper hierarchy? No default system fonts?
- COLOR: Is the palette industry-appropriate? ONE accent? Section bg variety?
- COPY: Is the text specific and compelling? No "Transform your X" or "Elevate your Y"?
- FUNCTIONALITY: Do buttons work? Forms validate? Mobile menu? Tabs/filters?
- UNIQUENESS: Would you mistake this for another site from the batch? Different from template #3?
- POLISH: Hover states? Scroll animations? Footer designed (not just ©)? Dark/light toggle?
- OVERALL: Would someone screenshot this and share it? Demo-worthy?

## Cycle 1: Fade & Fortune (Brooklyn Barbershop)
Score: 26/40
```
LAYOUT:       3/5 — Left-aligned hero OK, but 6 identical service cards in grid = banned pattern in spirit
TYPOGRAPHY:   4/5 — Bebas Neue + Oswald + Inter is a strong barbershop triple
COLOR:        3/5 — Red/cream/navy/dark works but not "vintage Americana" — missing warm aged tones
COPY:         3/5 — Service descriptions specific, but hero "CLASSIC CUTS / TIMELESS STYLE" is generic
FUNCTIONALITY: 4/5 — Services with prices, contact form, mobile menu, scroll reveals
UNIQUENESS:   3/5 — Fonts give personality but layout is generic dark services site
POLISH:       3/5 — Hover states, scroll reveals. No texture, no noise grain, no section bg variety
OVERALL:      3/5 — Decent but not screenshot-worthy. Missing the vintage soul
```
Failures: No vibe-to-design translation for "vintage Americana", identical card grid, no section bg variety, no dark/light toggle
Patch: Added VIBE TRANSLATION block, expanded AESTHETIC DIRECTION with barbershop entry

## Cycle 2: Sprout (Plant-Based Meal Delivery)
Score: 20/40
```
LAYOUT:       2/5 — Classic "How It Works" 3-step startup layout (BANNED pattern)
TYPOGRAPHY:   4/5 — Plus Jakarta Sans + Fraunces is strong editorial pairing
COLOR:        2/5 — Green (#16A34A) for plant-based = zero creativity
COPY:         2/5 — "Nourishing plant-based meals, delivered weekly" is AI slop. 3x "Get Started" (BANNED)
FUNCTIONALITY: 3/5 — Meal cards, theme toggle. Missing: plan selection, pricing, dietary filters
UNIQUENESS:   2/5 — Indistinguishable from any meal delivery landing page
POLISH:       3/5 — Theme toggle, bg variety, hover states
OVERALL:      2/5 — The canonical "I made this with an AI builder" page
```
Failures: "How It Works" steps (not banned in old prompt), "Get Started" CTA used 3x despite being banned, identical card pattern
Patch: Added "How It Works" and "Why Choose Us" to HARD-BANNED list, strengthened CTA bans, added Startup/DTC aesthetic direction

## Cycle 3: Vance & Wolfe (Criminal Defense Law Firm)
Score: 27/40
```
LAYOUT:       3/5 — Multi-page is good, but 6 identical practice area cards + "Why Choose Us" section
TYPOGRAPHY:   4/5 — Fraunces + Inter. Proper serif display for law
COLOR:        4/5 — Dark #0A0A0B + gold #D4AF37. Strong, appropriate
COPY:         3/5 — H1 "When Your Future Is on the Line" decent, but 6x "Learn more →" (BANNED)
FUNCTIONALITY: 4/5 — Attorney profiles, practice areas, contact form, page routing, mobile menu
UNIQUENESS:   3/5 — Dark+gold+serif law firm template but solid execution
POLISH:       3/5 — Theme toggle, gradient treatments, hover states. Banned patterns present
OVERALL:      3/5 — Looks like a real law firm site but not exceptional
```
Failures: "Why Choose Us" section (now banned), 6x "Learn more →" (now hard-banned), practice areas as identical cards instead of editorial blocks
Patch: Added "Why Choose Us" and "Learn more →" to HARD-BANNED, added CARD ALTERNATIVES section with editorial block/list/bento suggestions, strengthened law firm aesthetic to say "editorial blocks NOT identical cards"
